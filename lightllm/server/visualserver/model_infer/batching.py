    """Pull up to ``max_num`` image items from ``infer_queue`` while keeping the
    cumulative ``item.token_num`` at or below ``max_tokens``.

    Rank-0-only admission logic for the ViT scheduler. The first item is always
    admitted even when it alone exceeds ``max_tokens`` — this avoids a deadlock
    when a single request is larger than the per-step budget. Each subsequent
    item is pulled, inspected, and either kept or returned to the queue.

    ``semaphore`` counts share with the caller (see ``_init_taskes``); callers
    acquire before every get and release on over-pull so the permit count stays
    consistent with queue contents.

    When ``timeout`` is not None, the first acquire/get is bounded so rank 0
    can emit a heartbeat broadcast instead of blocking indefinitely on the
    gloo broadcast (avoids the 30-minute NCCL-style timeout on idle workers).
    An empty list is returned on timeout.
